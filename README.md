# [Injury Likelihood Predictor App] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Null Pointers]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Mariena Thomas] - [VJCET]
- Member 2: [Shreya Merin Mathew] - [VJCET]
- Member 3: [Jose Martin Binu] - [VJCET]

### Project Description
[The Ouch Predictor 3000 leverages a Random Forest Classifier to evaluate user input and predict the likelihood of injuries. This user-friendly web application is built using Streamlit, allowing users to interactively assess their injury risk and receive insights.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Future Injury Prediction for Athletes ]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[User Input: Users can enter physical attributes to assess their injury risk.
Injury Risk Prediction: The model predicts whether the risk of injury is high, medium, or low.
Simplified Classification Report: The app presents an easy-to-understand classification report summarizing the model's performance.]

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
-Python: The primary programming language for the project.
Streamlit: For creating the web application interface.
Scikit-learn: To implement machine learning algorithms and metrics.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.


### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
[git clone https://github.com/tinkerhub/useless_project_temp

cd useless_project_temp

pip install -r requirements.txt
]

# Run
[streamlit run app.py
]
